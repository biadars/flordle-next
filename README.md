# Spotify Web Playback SDK Example by Next.js and TypeScript
This is an example app that is rewritten from the official [Spotify Web Playback SDK Javascript Tutorial](https://github.com/spotify/spotify-web-playback-sdk-example) with **Next.js** and **Typescript**.

## Using your own credentials
You will need to register your app and get your own credentials from the
[Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

To do so, go to your Spotify for Developers Dashboard, create your
application and register the following callback URI:

`http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback`

Once you have created your app, create a file called `.env` in the root folder
of the repository with your Spotify credentials:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='my_client_id'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='my_client_secret'
```

## Installation

These examples run on Node.js. On its
[website](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) you can find instructions on how to
install it.

Once installed, clone the repository and install its dependencies running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the example

Start both client and server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The React application will start on `http://localhost:5000`
